future work:
* make demo more interesting
* keep scroll position in local storage instead of window name
* make links in footnotes create a new footnote somehow? not super important
    * idea: put footnote content in display: none element right after footnote reference, then bindery should be able to pick up on contained links

* test the entire thing with the markdeep feature demo, fix whatever issues crop up, document which markdeep features aren't supported








```
I've made another¹ thing that bends Markdeep to my will:

Write your {Bachelor,Master}'s thesis with Markdeep, MathJax and Bindery:
