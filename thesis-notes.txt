page numbers in toc
    figure out how to do this
    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("a[name='introduction/testingthisthing']")).forEach(e => console.log(e.parentNode))

mathjax
    run it after markdeep... but how?
    only then, when it's all done and svgs have been generated, run bindery

force use of https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif instead of os-installed pt serif (which on mac has no umlauts)
same for pt sans narrow
    => download the webfonts (also goes for all others)
    => sort of keep track of their licenses, for eventual release


gobble parens around citations into citation (both in text view and in references list)
style div.nonumerh1, ...h2 etc.
fancyquotes with 📖-continues should not have closing thingy, equivalent for 📖-continuation and opening thingy




generally support more heading levels that h1-3?
