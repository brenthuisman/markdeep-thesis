* style admonitions better
* gobble parens around citations into citation (both in text view and in references list)
* figure out how best to avoid page breaks for captioned code
* set numbers in toc and headings with proper spacing, i.e. 1 having the same with as 0, also revisit toc right margin of numbers
* test the entire thing with the markdeep demo, fix whatever issues crop up
    * document which markdeep features aren't supported
* force use of https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif instead of os-installed pt serif (which on mac has no umlauts)
    * same for pt sans narrow
    * download and rename the webfonts (also goes for all others)
    * sort of keep track of their licenses, for eventual release
    * although chrome seems to use the webfonts either way, so whatever
* marry mathjax/markdeep with unicodemathml







## release

```
I've made another¹ thing that bends Markdeep to my will:

Write your {Bachelor,Master}'s thesis with Markdeep, MathJax and Bindery:
https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-thesis

(CC @CasualEffects)

¹ Previously: https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides
```

demo:

=> come up with some weird area of study and subject
=> reviewing profs: morgan, bovik
=> reference Bovik, H. "Breath-First Techniques for the Game of Life",  in Artificial Intelligences Health, 5(88-108), 1998.

note in readme:

* this is kinda fragile
* only one style: what i used for my own msc thesis, might not really be standard across the world
* liable to break with markdeep and bindery updates if they change the generated markup
* advertise markdeep-slides
* only print in chrome etc.
* (figure out why chrome seems to forget *part* of the styling (h1 sizes, <code> visibility, admonition title border-bottom, etc.) when entering print mode)
    * => print in Chrome via the browser menu item, not cmp+P!
