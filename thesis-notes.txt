page numbers in toc
    transform toc into table or something to make it possible to work with (modify markdeep or do it after the fact?)
    before invoking bindery, write name of a targets into h tag data attributes, then use that?
    Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("a[name='introduction/testingthisthing']")).forEach(e => console.log(e.parentNode))

mathjax
    run it after markdeep
    only then, when it's all done, run bindery

force use of https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif instead of os-installed pt serif (which on mac has no umlauts)
same for pt sans narrow

* {
    line-height: 1.4em;
} ?


gobble parens around citations into citation (both in text view and in references list)

remove extra pages from the end
