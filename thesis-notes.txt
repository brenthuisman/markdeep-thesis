mathjax
    run it after markdeep... but how?
    only then, when it's all done and svgs have been generated, run bindery

force use of https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif instead of os-installed pt serif (which on mac has no umlauts)
same for pt sans narrow
    => download the webfonts (also goes for all others)
    => sort of keep track of their licenses, for eventual release
    => although chrome seems to use the webfonts either way, so whatever


gobble parens around citations into citation (both in text view and in references list)
style admonitions


fix line numbers being restarted when a code block is broken on a page

avoid page breaks for non-image figures: code, i guess?



does mathjax ignore <code>?
