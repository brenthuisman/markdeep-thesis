# markdeep-thesis

major things addressed by this work:

* page breaking, with custom header/footer/page number, i.e. not the ones automatically inserted by the browser in print view, which are ugly
    * coerce a pre-existing js library for column layouts or something into doing most of the work
* footnotes at the bottom of the corresponding pages instead of markdeep's default endnotes
* custom aspect ratio/paper formats: a4, letter, ...
* good styling for readability etc.

* maybe a data structure for references??? might be going too far for now, perhaps future work



* style things (fonts! code! etc.), also page numbers etc.
* integrate markdeep footnotes into bindery somehow
* make a non-print view that's larger, for actually writing? restore scroll position on refresh, see torsten's script
