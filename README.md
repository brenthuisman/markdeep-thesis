# markdeep-thesis

TODO

* no page number on first two pages (title page and intentionally left blank)
* this is kinda fragile
* only one style: what i used for my own msc thesis, might not really be standard across the world
* liable to break with markdeep and bindery updates if they change the generated markup
* advertise markdeep-slides
* only print in chrome etc.
* (figure out why chrome seems to forget *part* of the styling (h1 sizes, <code> visibility, admonition title border-bottom, etc.) when entering print mode)
    * => print in Chrome via the browser menu item, not cmp+P!
* major things addressed by this work:
    * page breaking, with custom header/footer/page number, i.e. not the ones automatically inserted by the browser in print view, which are ugly
    * footnotes at the bottom of the corresponding pages instead of markdeep's default endnotes
    * custom aspect ratio/paper formats: a4, letter, ...
        * => try this out!
    * good styling for readability etc.
