# markdeep-thesis

major things addressed by this work:

* page breaking, with custom header/footer/page number, i.e. not the ones automatically inserted by the browser in print view, which are ugly
    * coerce a pre-existing js library for column layouts or something into doing most of the work
* footnotes at the bottom of the corresponding pages instead of markdeep's default endnotes
* custom aspect ratio/paper formats: a4, letter, ...
* good styling for readability etc.

* maybe a data structure for references??? might be going too far for now, perhaps future work
